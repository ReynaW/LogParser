<--- LOG PARSER --->

This executable is made for use in emulated Pokemon games which have been randomized and given a log file using the Universal Pokemon Randomizer.
I created this project for use with a group of friends during randomizer races- it allows you to view select bits of data without being spoiled
on every single bit of randomized data in the game. 


This was built for use in Pokemon Black and White 2 randomizers, so it may not work in other versions. 
I tried to be robust and look for every single randomization setting, but there may be one I missed.


Copy and paste your log data into log.txt - the program will fail to run if it's given a different name or is missing data. 
The program comes preloaded with stock randomization settings.


To run, execute logparser.exe.
